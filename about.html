         <h1> <strong> About me </strong> </h1>
        
           <p> Welcome to my portfolio this section is to give you insist to who I am as a person. I have a bachelors degree in health sciences.
               I've always enjoyed computers,technology, photography and working out.
               which is why I decided to pursue a degree in computer science.
               I love to problem solve and I enjoy the rush you get when you crack a puzzle or complete a challenging problem. 
               I like to apply different areas of my life to problems I'm trying to solve now. As an example I like photography and taking photos. 
               For photography sometimes you have to be patient and wait for the right time to take a photo other times you have to take a picture from the right angle or direction to get your percieved outcome.
               You essentially have to problem solve. I feel like this idea and concept can be applied to computer science and programming as a whole, but not just that but life all together.
