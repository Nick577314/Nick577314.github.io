         <h1> <strong> About me </strong> </h1>
        <p> Welcome to my portfolio this section is to give you insist to who I am as a person. I've always enjoyed computers and technology alike.
            I chose a degree that was almost endless, with computer science I can create so many different things. Outside of school I like too take photos and exercise whenever ever I have time off.
