               Welcome to my portfolio this section is to give you insight to who I am as a person. I have a bachelors degree in health sciences. I've always enjoyed computers, technology, photography and working out. which is why I decided to pursue a degree in computer science. I love to problem solve and I enjoy the rush you get when you crack a puzzle or complete a challenging problem. 
               I like to apply different areas of my life to problems I'm trying to solve now. As an example I like photography and taking photos. For photography sometimes you have to be patient and wait for the right time to take a photo other times you have to take a picture from the right angle or direction to get your percieved outcome.
               You essentially have to problem solve. I feel like this idea and concept can be applied to computer science and programming as a whole, but not just that but life all together.
